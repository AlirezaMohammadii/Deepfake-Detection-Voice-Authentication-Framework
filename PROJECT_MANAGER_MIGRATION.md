python project_manager.py    # Run project manager
# Choose option 2              # Show current structure
# Choose option 5              # Analyze reset impact (preview only)
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test the Migration
```bash
# 1. Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Test unified project manager
python project_manager.py

# 3. Try each menu option:
#    - Option 1: Test folder management
#    - Option 2: Show structure  
#    - Option 3: Analyze cleanup
#    - Option 5: Analyze reset (safe preview)

# 4. Verify old files are removed
# Should not exist: cleanup_unnecessary_files.py, test_folder_setup.py
```

### Verify Reset Functionality
```bash
# 1. Run analysis to generate content
echo "4" | python test_runner.py

# 2. Test reset analysis (safe)

# Choose option 5 - shows what would be reset

# 3. If needed, test actual reset
python project_manager.py
